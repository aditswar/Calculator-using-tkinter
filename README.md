# Calculator GUI (Python Tkinter)

A simple calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library.  
It supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with a clean graphical user interface.  

### Features
- User-friendly GUI with buttons for digits and operations  
- Handles basic arithmetic calculations  
- Error handling for invalid operations (like division by zero)  

## Current issues (fixing soon)
- Button sizes arent responsive to be equal to each other
- Code can be way simpler using loops for creating most buttons
